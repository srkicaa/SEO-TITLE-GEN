Use the anchor text only when it reads naturally inside supporting copy, never inside the title.\n4. Titles must exclude https://howtocancelmytimeshare.com/cancel-your-villa-group-timeshare/ and any casino/operator brand names entirely; reserve brand mentions for rationales.\n5.

Keep every title free of review or promo phrasing (e.g., avoid 'review', 'bonus', 'promo code').\n\nExamples:\n- Bad: \"Casiny online casino review\" (violates brand + review rule).\n- Good: \"Bankroll-friendly casino formats poker players can trust\" (brand-free, contextual).\n\nReturn JSON exactly as {\"titles\": [{\"title\": \"...\", \"rationale\": \"...\"}]} with 5 items.",
