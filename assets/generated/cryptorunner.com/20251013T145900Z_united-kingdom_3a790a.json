Make every title feel native to cryptorunner.com while naturally justifying a link to https://sterling-savvy.co.uk/en/.\n3. Use the anchor text only when it reads naturally inside supporting copy, never inside the title.\n4.

Keep every title free of review or promo phrasing (e.g., avoid 'review', 'bonus', 'promo code').\n\nExamples:\n- Bad: \"Casiny online casino review\" (violates brand + review rule).\n- Good: \"Bankroll-friendly casino formats poker players can trust\" (brand-free, contextual).\n\nReturn JSON exactly as {\"titles\": [{\"title\": \"...\", \"rationale\": \"...\"}]} with 5 items.",
