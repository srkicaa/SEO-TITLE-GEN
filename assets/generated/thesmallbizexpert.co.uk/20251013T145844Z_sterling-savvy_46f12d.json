  "prompt_text": "Content Title Creation Brief\nObjective: craft 5 link-ready titles for https://sterling-savvy.co.uk/en/ that feel at home on thesmallbizexpert.co.uk.\n\nReference SERP keyword: crypto\nAnchor keyword (use only if natural): Sterling Savvy\n\nAnchor operates in: United Kingdom\n\nReference titles:\n- How You Can Enhance Your Small Business In 3 Steps\n\nGuidance:\n1. Combine your own knowledge of thesmallbizexpert.co.uk's catalog with the SERP references to surface authentic angles.\n2. Make every title feel native to thesmallbizexpert.co.uk while naturally justifying a link to https://sterling-savvy.co.uk/en/.\n3. Use the anchor text only when it reads naturally inside supporting copy, never inside the title.\n4. Titles must exclude Sterling Savvy and any casino/operator brand names entirely; reserve brand mentions for rationales.\n5. If extra notes or your knowledge indicate a placement locale, tailor the titles accordingly; otherwise keep them globally applicable while acknowledging United Kingdom where useful.\n6. Incorporate any extra campaign notes: .\n7. Keep every title free of review or promo phrasing (e.g., avoid 'review', 'bonus', 'promo code').\n\nExamples:\n- Bad: \"Casiny online casino review\" (violates brand + review rule).\n- Good: \"Bankroll-friendly casino formats poker players can trust\" (brand-free, contextual).\n\nReturn JSON exactly as {\"titles\": [{\"title\": \"...\", \"rationale\": \"...\"}]} with 5 items.",
