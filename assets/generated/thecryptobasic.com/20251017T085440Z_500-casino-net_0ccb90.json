Combine your own knowledge of thecryptobasic.com's catalog with the SERP references to surface authentic angles.\n2. Make every title feel native to thecryptobasic.com while naturally justifying a link to https://500-casino.net/.\n3. Use the anchor text only when it reads naturally inside supporting copy, never inside the title.\n4. Titles must exclude 500-casino.net and any casino/operator brand names entirely; reserve brand mentions for rationales.\n5. If extra notes or your knowledge indicate a placement locale, tailor the titles accordingly; otherwise keep them globally applicable while acknowledging Unspecified where useful.\n6. Incorporate any extra campaign notes: .\n7. Keep every title free of review or promo phrasing (e.g., avoid 'review', 'bonus', 'promo code').\n\nExamples:\n- Bad: \"Casiny online casino review\" (violates brand + review rule).\n- Good: \"Bankroll-friendly casino formats poker players can trust\" (brand-free, contextual).\n\nReturn JSON exactly as {\"titles\": [{\"title\": \"...\", \"rationale\": \"...\"}]} with 5 items.",
